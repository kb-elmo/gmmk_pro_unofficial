These files were created by me and were graciously accepted for redistribution by Glorious PC Gaming.

For rendering the board with Blender the FBX format works best since it already contains different material groups.  
A STEP file is included as well for easier conversion to other mesh model formats.

Keycaps and/or switches are NOT included in this model!

The files you find in this repository are meant solely for rendering and showcase purposes!  
They only contain the outside shell of this keyboard and do not reveal any kind of internal structure of the original design created by Glorious PC Gaming and are in no way suitable for manufacturing a "clone" unit.
